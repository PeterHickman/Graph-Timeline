Graph::Timeline - Manipulate and display timelines

This is release V1.5 of Graph::Timeline. The class 
is used to show timelines.

Look in the examples directory for a program showing how to use the
module and some sample data. The first type of chart is the traditional
sort you see in history books showing the lives of famous people against
the timeline of world events.

The second type lists events down the page, starting with the eariest.
This will form a sort of diagonal. Used less for historical data and more
for charting processes.

You can also generate an imagemap for this image

INSTALLATION

 % perl Makefile.PL
 % make
 % make test
 % sudo make install

TEST FAILURES

The tests are there to make sure that I have broken nothing when I
fiddle with the code and will teach you very little about how to use
the code.

  1971 accepted for 'start' and 'end' dates for intervals and points.

BUGS
